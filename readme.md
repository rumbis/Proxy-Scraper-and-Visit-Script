# Proxy Scraper and Visit Script

This repository contains a Python scraper and a JavaScript visit script for web scraping and website visits.

## Python Scraper

The Python scraper is built using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library and [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library for making HTTP requests.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Beautiful Soup library
- Requests library

### Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
   ```

2. Modify the scraper.py file to specify the target website and the data you want to scrape.

3. Run the scraper.py file:

   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

4. The scraped data will be displayed in the console or saved to a file, depending on your implementation.

## JavaScript Visit Script

The JavaScript visit script uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) library for automated website visits.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Puppeteer library

### Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install puppeteer
   ```

2. Modify the visit.js file to specify the target websites, proxies, user agents, and other options as needed.
